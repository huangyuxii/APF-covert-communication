Short Explanation: 

optimal_main : decide which case according to the simulation setup 
a. insufficient_optimal: the case of insufficient task time 
b. sufficient_optimal: the case of sufficient task time

potential: calculate APF in covert communication

force: calculate twisted force in covert communication

isopleth: plot APF figure under different covertness requirements

xxplot.m: the figureplot for paper in the first revision. The second revision figures are not include.
